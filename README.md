# Fonts

These are open source font that I like to use in my documents and that are used in the [TimothyElder/pandoc-teamplates](https://github.com/TimothyElder/pandoc-templates) and [latex-custom-te](https://github.com/TimothyElder/latex-custom-te) repos. A shell script is included to install them on macOS and you can run it with:

```sh
cd ~/Documents
git clone https://github.com/TimothyElder/open-fonts.git
chmod +x install_fonts.sh
./install_fonts.sh
```

If you are using Windows, you are on your own regarding the installation, but [this page](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/add-a-font-b7c5f17c-4426-4b53-967f-455339c564c1) should be helpful.
